   .. py:method:: build_schedule_item(self, purpose: str, next_meeting_start_time: Optional[int]) -> ScheduleItem

      Given a purpose and additional properties such as meeting duration,
      build a schedule item for this agent.

      :param purpose: The purpose for this schedule item.
      :type purpose: str
      :param next_meeting_start_time: Start of any upcoming meeting. None if
          there is no upcoming meeting.
      :type next_meeting_start_time: int
      :raises ValueError: If no suitable location is found for this purpose.
      :return: The newly created schedule item.
      :rtype: ScheduleItem

   .. py:method:: find_next_schedule_item(self) -> ScheduleItem

      Check if a meeting is happening within MEETING_BUFFER time. If so,
      return the meeting as the next schedule item, otherwise, build a new
      item that must ned before the next meeting time for this agent.

      ..Note:: MEETING BUFFER is a constant specified in settings.

      :return: The next schedule item.
      :rtype: ScheduleItem

   .. py:method:: find_possible_purposes(self) -> List[str]

      Feturn list of possible purposes for this agent in this facility.

      Iterate over purposes defined in scheduling rules and compare with
      purposes specified for the different locations in this facility. The
      possible purposes are the ones for which at least one location is
      available.

      ..Note:: Possible purposes are not checked for validity based on
      scheduling rules.

      :return: list of possible purposes.
      :rtype: List[str]

      Calculate the maximum duration possible for a given scheduling purpose
      while taking into account any upcoming meeting after this schedule
      item.

      :param purpose: The purpose of the next meeting.
      :type purpose: str
      :param next_meeting_start_time: Start time of the next meeting.
      :type next_meeting_start_time: int

      Iterate over schedule items and count how many items each scheduling
      purpose exists.

      :return: List of counts, one per possible purpose.

      Iterate through list of purposes under consideration, remove any that
      doesn't satisfy exisiting scheduling rules.

      :param next_meeting_start_time: Start time of any upcoming meeting.
      :type next_meeting_start_time: int

   .. py:method:: choose_valid_scheduling_purpose(self, next_meeting_start_time: Optional[int]) -> str

      Find a valid scheduling purpose using rules defined in the
      scheduling policy for this facility. Common purposes include:
      restroom visits, lab work, office work and cafeteria visit.

      :param next_meeting_start_time: Start time of the next meeting
      :type next_meeting_start_time: Optional[int]

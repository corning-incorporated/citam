.. py:class:: Agent(unique_id: int, schedule: citam.engine.policy.daily_schedule.Schedule, name: Optional[str] = None, office_id: Optional[int] = None, job_function: Optional[str] = None)

   
   The agent in Agent-based modeling. An agent represents a user of the
   facility (employee or otherwise). An agent has a schedule (and associated
   itinerary) that they follow throughout the day. This also keeps track of
   the number of contacts that this agent has had so far.

   .. py:method:: step(self)

      
      Move this agent one step forward in its itinerary.

      This updates the agent's current position only if the agent's itinerary
      indicates a different location.

      :return: whether the agent has moved from its current location or not.

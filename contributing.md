How to Contribute
-------------------

We welcome contributions of all types including new test cases, new features, improved documentation, etc.

During javascript development, it is useful to have a live-compiler
      set up, so you can test changes without recompiling the app.
      To run a live-compiler instance, change directory to `citamjs` and run
      `npm run serve`
